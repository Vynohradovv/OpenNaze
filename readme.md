In early 2016, I began designing an all-in-one flight controller out of self-curiousity and the desire to have a tightly-integrated FC with integrate PDB and OSD system. I ended up completing it right around the same time many commercial FCs began including many of the features I was looking for. I took it as far as the prototype phase, but didn't push it any further.

I recently remembered the files and decided to open-source them; it was my goal all along and it seems like a waste to do so much (FUN) reverse-engineering of hardware and firmware without sharing with others who may be interested.
